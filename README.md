# mercurialworld's Iris Rev. 7 layout

Based mainly off the [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) layout with some adjustments (no mouse layer, QWERTY/Colemak non-DH switch, Win/Mac toggle for NAV shortcuts).

Place under `keyboards/keebio/iris/keymaps`.

Reference the [Miryoku reference](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference) for now.
